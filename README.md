# Groovy

https://groovy-sigma.vercel.app

## Description

Groovy is an interactive music website where users can explore some of my favorite artists, hear some of their music, find out about and keep track of their upcoming shows and chat with an AI assistant to learn more about them.

I built this app to get more experience with React/Next.js and AI. I thought it would be fun to make a project that integrates my love for music and has everything I would want to know about an artist in one convenient place.
